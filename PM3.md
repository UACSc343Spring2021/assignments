## Project Milestone 3 - Due Tuesday, March 2, 11:59 PM

Version History: 

- Released 2020/2/19

The subject of the project continues to be either:

1. an online menu/food ordering systems

2. an inventory management interface for a video game


Due Tuesday March 2, 11:59 PM (group), and thirty minutes later for the
individual portion.

In this milestone we are:

- Coming to consensus with our newlly formed team
- Stating the agreed-upon context of use of our projectt
- Stating clearly what it means to perform the main task and prioritizing
  additional features
- Creating and demonstrating a low fidelity prototype
- Explaining the rationale for your choice of design concept
- Individually stating our contributions and the contributions of our team
  members to this milestone.

The HTML, Javascript, and CSS should be in separate files. No style
information should be in the HTML tags outside of a style attribute. Do not
use HTML tags like `<center>`, `<b>`, or `<i>` to alter visual appearance. Avoid the
use of CSS `position: fixed`; because it may cause elements to overlap and be
unreadable on the grader's setup.

With your team members, decide on a team name.

Create a team repository:
[https://classroom.github.com/g/31XDOk5g](https://classroom.github.com/g/31XDOk5g).
The first team member will to follow this link should name this repository
using your teams name (or a shortening/acronym of it). These team names will
persist through the rest of this project and be visible to your classmmates in
later milestones. The remaining team members will then use this link to join
the team repository under the give name.

At the time of submission, the team repository should contain one HTML file named `PM3.html`
and any other files needed by the assignment (CSS files, Javascript files,
image or media needed).

Use the following link to create your individual github repository for this
assignment:
[https://classroom.github.com/a/1a93ZZA0](https://classroom.github.com/a/1a93ZZA0).
At the time of submission it should contain a text file named
`PM3-evaluations.txt`. **This individual report is used to assess individual
contributions to the group work. If you don't submit one, we can only go on
what others have said and your individual commits.**


### Content - Header information 

At the top of your report, state the names of all the team members as well as
your team name. You can name your team what you like as long as it is
professionally appropriate. Note this team name will be shared with the class.

#### Team Organization (5 pts)

Create a header "Team Organization". In prose or a list, whichever works
better for your team, describe your team's organization in terms of
communication (e.g., email, Discord) and other ground rules you have agreed
upon (e.g., when materials must be in by, understanding that a certain member
can only respond at night, etc).

This portion of the milestone exists to encourage you to discuss these issues
and to make the decisions explicit rather than assuming.


#### Context of Use (10 pts)

Write clearly the context of use for your food ordering system or game
inventory system as in PM2.

In PM2, some of you discussed the type of restaurant or game you would
support. Your context of use should refine this in terms of what your
expectations are regarding the menu and what the user could do. It may help to
be specific. Instead of a general system for your type of restaurant or
game, come up with a concrete idea of what your restaurant or game is. For
example, for the restaurant: what kind of food they serve and what's on their
menu. For the game: what the general theme is and what items are in the
inventory. You may want to constrain the items at first but discuss how it
could become more complicated as the project allows. 

Write your context of use in prose (i.e., paragraphs) under a header "Context
of Use." 

This portion of the milestone exists to communicate to us and your fellow team
members the consensus context.


#### Statement of Tasks (20 pts)

The header for this section should be "Statement of Tasks."

For this project, we are focusing on the main goal of:

1. MENU: Ordering a meal.
2. GAME: (pick one) Choosing either (1) piece of armor/accessory to equip or  (2) an item to use. 

As a group, construct a set of sub-tasks that are the bare minimum for
supporting this goal. Write this as a (potentially nested) ordered list under
a sub-header "Minimum Proposed Tasks." Underneath the list, write a paragraph
explaining your rationale for these minimum tasks. You may refer to PM1 and
other experience to support this rationale. 

The purpose of the Minimum Tasks is to initially constrain the focus of the
project. In that way, it acts like a project proposal. 

Create an ordered list of sub-tasks that are non-essential but you foresee
increasing the usability of your system. The list should be ordered by
importance. Write this as a (potentially nested) ordered list under a
sub-header "Extended Proposed Tasks." Underneath the list, write a paragraph
explaining your rationale for these tasks. You may refer to PM1 and other
experience to support this rationale.

The purpose of the Extended Tasks is to:

1. Anticipate potential issues that come up during evaluation.
2. Aid in thinking about the extensibility of your design.
3. Aid in planning should the design, implementation, and evaluation of your
   Minimum Tasks run smoothly enough to allow you to extend the project.

The main idea is to start small and focused so you can have a complete
interface prototype but allow room to grow should the initial concept be too
small. You may want to start with the assumption of a limited menu/game for the
minimum tasks, but propose how the menu/game could become more complicated and thus
how the tasks should grow to support that. 

This portion of the milestone exists to develop a consensus of tasks and their
priority. It also exists to encourage you to start small and prioritize rather
than taking on too many UI features.  The project can always be expanded as
you discover where the needs are.


#### Prototype Design (25 pts)

From your combined PM1 and PM2 submissions, as well as your stated context and
tasks above, select and elaborate on an group design. 

Include the design as a mockup/sketch (not photos of the paper prototype).
Beneath the image, write your explanation of the design concept as a
paragraph. 

Beneath the design concept paragraph, create a sub-header "Design Rationale."
Write your rationale for the design. Given the amount of background you now
have from the previous milestones, I expect this rationale to be thorough.

Beneath the "Design Rationale", create a sub-header called "Supporting
Artifacts". Each artifact (or set of artifacts if there are many
sketches/images of the same idea) should be in its own collapsible area,
following the accordion interaction design pattern (you may need to look this
up on a design pattern site). Do not include all of your PM1s and PM2s, but
you may include excerpts from each as referenced by your design rationale. 

This portion of the milestone exists to come up with a strong consensus
design, underscored by a strong design rationale.


#### Low Fidelity Prototype (25 pts)

Create a low fidelity prototype. Originally, this assignment assumed a _paper
prototype_. A paper prototype is suitable because it is relatively quick to
create and potential users are typically willing to provide criticism because
they can see things are still quite changeable. However, it can be hard to
have people use a paper prototype remotely and difficult to create it
remotely. Here are some options:

1. Create a paper prototype. Take good quality photos of it so all team
   members can print their own copy. Have participants (Project Milestone 4)
in your social distancing bubble use it. (You could also have one person have
the copy and always act as the operator, with the user potentially giving
commands over Zoom.)

2. Create you paper prototype digitally with drawing programs or a
   presentation software like Powerpoint or Keynote. Then every team member
can print out the items, cut them out as necessary, and again sue them in
their bubble.

3. Create your prototype exclusively in online presentation software, where
   all updates to the prototype can be done by cut-n-paste, dragging, etc
operations by the operator. Thus, it can be used by participants online.

4. Create your prototype in a prototyping tool like Sketch (by Sketch B.V.),
   Figma (Figma, Inc.), or Adobe XD (if you have no-cost access to one). Your evaluation in
PM4 will be limited by what the tool you chose supports (e.g., online or
in-person).

5. If you have another idea, please ask the instructor on Piazza.

**DO NOT expand your social distancing bubble for the purposes of this
class.**

Embed a movie showing the prototype through three different “ordering lunch”
or "selecting a piece of equipment" scenarios. For example, one can show the
scenario of a user who is familiar with the interface and knows exactly what
she wants while another could show a user who has to do more searching.

**It is suggested you upload your movie with a video platform (e.g., Vimeo)
link or to a document sharing service rather than Github. Note if you upload
it to Google Drive, you must set global permissions as the instructor's
email.arizona.edu account does not link to email.arizona.edu's Google Drive.**

Please include audio to describe the scenario OR include text underneath the
embedded movie explaining what is happening in each scenario. It might not be
otherwise understandable in the movie.

Remember that this low fidelity prototype will be used for evaluation by people
outside this class in PM4. It should be nice enough that those participants
will understand what is going on during evaluation, but not so nice that
participants will hesitate to criticize. If you are creating your
low fidelity prototype with prototyping software, the latter is a threat.


### Format (10 pts)

The only constraints on the format, other than what is described above (e.g.,
accordion pattern) are:

- The report should be reasonably readable. For example, black text on a black
  background is not reasonable. 
- The headers should be differentiable from the body text and spacing should
  be used to help readability.
- There should be some persistent way for us to navigate between sections.
- The title should have your group name.  
- The report content should be 640 pixels wide with a 12 point sans-serif
  font for the report text.
- Sections of the report and navigation should not occlude each other


### Individual Evaluations (5 pts)

This content should be written by each individual after their work on the
project milestone is completed. Use the separate individual github classroom
link.

At the top of your evaluation, estimate the distribution of work contributed
by yourself and your teammates. You will do this by starting with 20 units for
each members of your team (a total of 60 for a 3 person team, 80 for a 4
person team). You will then apportion the units to yourself and your team
members to indicate distribution. If everyone has 20 units, that means equal
distribution.

**If there was a team member who was unresponsive/never participated, note
that at the top and don't include them, their 20 points, or a further peer
assessment of them.**

We will assess the distributions listed as well as the contributions described
for balance and may apply a weighting/scaling factor to individual grades to
account for discrepancies. More work does not necessarily mean a higher
grade---taking over the project and influencing others to not participate is
discouraged.

While we don't expect the distribution of points will be perfect (work may not
divide absolutely perfectly), we may adjust individual grades should we see
significant disbalances. We will read the text to ascertain if and why they
occurred. 


Example:
```
Unit Distribution

Blinky: 17

Pinky: 21

Inky: 22

Clyde: 20

```

The second paragraph should describe what your contributions to the project
milestone were:

```
Individual Contributions -- FamilyName, GivenName

My contributions were...
```

Then, for each of your team members, write a section headed with their name
explaining what their contributions were and rating them on:

1. Quality of Work
2. Timeliness of Work Completion
3. Contributions to Group Discussion
4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude

Ratings should be one of [Below Expectations, Good, Above and Beyond]. 

Beneath the ratings you may provide more detail explaining your ratings or any
other information we should know.


Example:
```
Peer Assessment -- FamilyName, GivenName

GivenName's contributions were... 

1. Quality of Work: Above and Beyond

2. Timeliness of Work Completion: Below Expectations

3. Contributions to Group Discussion: Good

4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude: Good

GivenName did a great job on the paper prototype but was two days later than
we planned so we had to scramble to make the movie.
```

Example 2:
```
Peer Assessment -- Otherfamily, OtherName

OtherName's contributions were... 

1. Quality of Work: Good

2. Timeliness of Work Completion: Below Expectations

3. Contributions to Group Discussion: Below Expectations

4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude: Good

OtherName did not respond to our attempts to contact them until two days
before the deadline. They helped with the final edits but the rest of the work
had mostly be discussed and apportioned by that time and we did not want to
de-rail the project by changing things at the last minute. They were
apologetic and plan to contribute earlier next milestone.
```

### Distribution

All team members should participate in the discussion of the context of use,
tasks, and initial design.

The team should strive to apportion equitably. It is up to the team how this
can be done. 

It may help to appoint different people to draft each writing section and then
someone else to check/edit the writing for completeness. Similarly, one person
can be in charge of assembling the webpage and another in charge of checking
it for compliance. 

One person may be in charge of designing the three initial scenarios, perhaps
with storyboards or step-by-step procedures, while another is in charge of
crafting the low-fi prototype (but others may help). A third person can then
prepare those storyboard for the accordion section of the report. One to two
people can demonstrate the prototype while a third one films if you are in the
same social distancing bubble.
