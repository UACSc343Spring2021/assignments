## Project Milestone 4 - Due Thurssday 3/18 @ 11:59 PM

Version History: 

- Updated due date 2021/3/1
- Released 2021/2/25

The team portion of this milestone is due Tuesday March 16, 11:59 PM (group)
and thirty minutes later for the indvidual portion.

In this milestone we are:

- Design an observational evaluation for your paper prototype
- Conduct the observational evaluation you designed.
- Analyzing the results of the evaluation 
- Reporting on the results of your analysis
- Individually stating your contributions and the contributions of your team
  members to this milestone.

The HTML, Javascript, and CSS should be in separate files. No style
information should be in the HTML tags outside of a style attribute. Do not
use HTML tags like `<center>`, `<b>`, or `<i>` to alter visual appearance. Avoid the
use of CSS `position: fixed`; because it may cause elements to overlap and be
unreadable on the grader's setup.

Please continue to use the same name that you used in PM3.


Create a team repository:
[https://classroom.github.com/g/mNcNtkuE](https://classroom.github.com/g/mNcNtkuE).
At the time of submission should contain one HTML file named `PM4.html.` It
should also include any CSS files, Javascript files, images or media needed
for the report and `PM4.html`. 

Use the following link to create your individual github repository for this
assignment:
[https://classroom.github.com/a/o5WblJXj](https://classroom.github.com/a/o5WblJXj).
At the time of submission, it should contain a text file named
`PM4-evaluations.txt.` The file should have the content described under
Individual Evaluations below. This is a similar format used in PM3. Also, the
notes on how you may want to distribute the work are different. 

### Conducting the Evaluations

You should conduct the evaluation on one person for each team member.
Therefore, if your group has 3 people, you will conduct 3 evaluations. If your
group has 4 people, you will conduct 4 evaluations. Not every team member must
be present at every evaluation but **each team member must participate in at
least one observation session in some role (e.g., facilitator, observer).**

The observation should be done with a low-fidelity prototype where the participant
interacts with the prototype. Showing a participants a movie of the prototype
and asking for their reactions is not sufficient for this assignment.

If it is not possible to have the participant directly interact with the
prototype due to social distancing, another way in which this can be conducted
is to have the participant tell the facilitator what to do and then have the
facilitator act it out (e.g., audio directions to a prototype they see on
video). For example, the participant can say "Press the Okay button" and the
facilitator will press it and then alter the prototype in response to that
action. They will then await the next command. Note in this case, the
direction by the participant should be done on the interface level.
Directions like "Order a tea" are too high level.

The materials related to your evaluation should be included as below:


### Content 

#### Header Information

At the top of your report, state the names of all the team members as well as
your team name. Also include an image of your low fidelity prototype design. 

#### Section I: Observation Design (30 pts)

Create a section that includes your briefing and de-briefing scripts, a
description of your tasks (what you will ask them to do), and a list of your
interview questions for the observation. Each of these four artifacts should
be clearly separated from each other so they can be differentiated. Giving
them subheaders or otherwise labeling them will help.

Focus on the task of: 

1. MENU: Ordering a meal.
2. GAME: Choosing either piece of armor/accessory to equip or an item to use
   (whichever makes more sense in your context of use)

You will be graded on the appropriateness of these materials (briefing,
de-briefing, tasks, interview questions). You may include a Rationale
sub-section to explain any choices you made.

#### Section III: Observational Analysis (30 pts)

After conducting the observations, analyze the results of the observations and
report on the analysis as described in Lecture 13. The expectation is that
initial codes will be agreed upon early, at least two people will code the
observations, it will be clear how the observations were coded (what units
were used, what codes match which units), and groupings of related codes,
their prevalence, and intercoder agreement will be reported on.


#### Section III: Suggestions for Improvement (10 pts)

Based on the analysis of the previous section, create a prioritized list of
suggestions for improvements upon the design. Included in these suggestions
may be design elements that should not change. Explain the prioritization.

#### Appendix: Observation Artifacts (20 pts)

Your observation artifacts should be included in the report. Artifacts can
include raw notes, audio, visual, etc. If you recorded audio or visual but
your participants would prefer these not be shared, a transcript should be
included. 

Each observation session should produce some of its own artifacts and these
should be clearly differentiated from each other so an outsider (like the
grader) can know which artifacts go with which session. 

The team members participating in each observation should be listed with the
artifacts along with their role for that observation.  

Your observation conduct and your artifact creation will be evaluated in terms
of level of detail and clear separation of facts from inference. We will
assess if notes are to appropriate level of detail (e.g., containing actions
taken, time taken between actions, what is known about tone or expression) or
if raw video is used instead, if it is well-referenced/summarized in the
analysis (e.g., are the parts used as evidence well-described/noted/annotated
and is is the analysis using all of it). We will only grant credit where
participants used the interface (even if by directing the facilitator to push
specific buttons).

Team members who do not participate in an observation will not receive credit
for this section.


### Format (5 pts)

The only constraints on the format, other than those described above, as are
in PM3:

- The report should be reasonably readable. For example, black text on a black
  background is not reasonable. 
- The headers should be differentiable from the body text and spacing should
  be used to help readability.
- There should be some persistent way for me to navigate between sections.
- The title should have your group name.  
- The report content should be 640 pixels wide with a 12 point sans-serif
  font for the report text.



### Individual Evaluations (5 pts)

This content should be written by each individual after the project milestone is
submitted. Use the separate individual github classroom link.

At the top of your evaluation, estimate the distribution of work contributed
by yourself and your teammates. You will do this by starting with 20 units for
each members of your team (a total of 60 for a 3 person team, 80 for a 4
person team). You will then apportion the units to yourself and your team
members to indicate distribution. If everyone has 20 units, that means equal
distribution.

**If there was a team member who was unresponsive/never participated, note
that at the top and don't include them, their 20 points, or a further peer
assessment of them.**

We will assess the distributions listed as well as the contributions described
for balance and may apply a weighting/scaling factor to individual grades to
account for discrepancies. More work does not necessarily mean a higher
grade--taking over the project and influencing others to not participate is
discouraged.

While we don't expect the distribution of points will be perfect (work may not
divide absolutely perfectly), we may adjust individual grades should we see
significant disbalances. We will read the text to ascertain if and why they
occurred. 


Example:
```
Unit Distribution

Blinky: 17

Pinky: 21

Inky: 22

Clyde: 20

```

**If the distribution is largely uneven, please make a note as to why it
was not evenly apportioned and what was done to try to divide it evenly.**

The second paragraph should describe what your contributions to the project
milestone were:

```
Individual Contributions -- FamilyName, GivenName

My contributions were...
```

Then, for each of your team members, write a section headed with their name
explaining what their contributions were and rating them on:

1. Quality of Work
2. Timeliness of Work Completion
3. Contributions to Group Discussion
4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude

Ratings should be one of [Below Expectations, Good, Above and Beyond]. 

Beneath the ratings you may provide more detail explaining your ratings or any
other information we should know.


Example:
```
Peer Assessment -- FamilyName, GivenName

GivenName's contributions were... 

1. Quality of Work: Above and Beyond

2. Timeliness of Work Completion: Below Expectations

3. Contributions to Group Discussion: Good

4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude: Good

GivenName did a great job on the paper prototype but was two days later than
we planned so we had to scramble to make the movie.


Example 2:
```
Peer Assessment -- Otherfamily, OtherName

OtherName's contributions were... 

1. Quality of Work: Good

2. Timeliness of Work Completion: Below Expectations

3. Contributions to Group Discussion: Below Expectations

4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude: Good

OtherName did not respond to our attempts to contact them until two days
before the deadline. They helped with the final edits but the rest of the work
had mostly be discussed and apportioned by that time and we did not want to
de-rail the project by changing things at the last minute. They were
apologetic and plan to contribute earlier next milestone.
```

### Distribution

All team members should participate in the discussion of evaluation design,
observations themselves, and suggestions for improvement. At least two team
members should participate in the analysis.

The team should strive to apportion equitably. It is up to the team how this
can be done. 

It may help to appoint different people to draft each writing section and then
someone else to check/edit the writing for completeness. Similarly, one person
can be in charge of assembling the webpage and another in charge of checking
it for compliance. 

One way to divide up the observations is to have each team member recruit one
participant and then act as facilitator for that participant and then observer
on someone else's participant. However, if this proves difficult for a team
member, the work can be divided up differently with the team member
participating less in the observations doing more work on the analysis,
writing, and/or web page assembly.
